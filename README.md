# Customer Information Management API using Python Flask (No DB)
This is a starter project for building a Customer Information Management API using Python Flask. The API provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customer information, but does not store the data in any database. Instead, it uses in-memory data structures to store and manipulate customer records.

This project is intended as a starting point for developers who want to build their own custom Customer Information Management APIs using Flask. By using this project as a base, developers can save time and effort in implementing the basic functionality of the API and focus on adding their own custom features and integrations.

### Features
* Create new customer records
* Retrieve all customers record
* Retrieve customer information by ID
* Update existing customer records
* Delete customer records
* In-memory data storage

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 or later
* Flask 1.1.2 or later

### Usage
To use the API, simply clone the repository and run the app.py file using Python. The API will be hosted on http://localhost:5000 by default. You can then use any HTTP client (e.g., cURL, Postman) to interact with the API and perform CRUD operations on customer records.
